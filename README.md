Egg Tab is a client-side Minecraft mod that moves all mob spawn eggs to a new Spawn Eggs creative tab. It also adds other optional creative tabs such as an Enchanted Books tab and a Creative-only items tab.
All tabs can be enabled/disabled through mod menu or config file. This mod also works with mods that add additional items, like spawn eggs and enchanted books.
